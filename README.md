# Cryptocurrencies
### Overview
This respitory is a analysis of multiple cryptocurrencies for an investment bank which is in the process of offering crypto as another avenue of investment for customers. The data used for my analysis had to be cleaned and structured in a format that allowed for analysis to be done. Unsupervised machine learning was used for my analysis. The data was put in clusters and visualized.
